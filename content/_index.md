Bunny (_bunny_, not _bunny lang_) aims to be a simple, practical, and fun general purpose dynamic programming language.

The motivation is to produce a concrete language specification with wish-list features from it's inspirations. The goal is to bundle the most developer-friendly features into a cohesive and enjoyable language.

It is inspired by classic Lisps like Common Lisp and Scheme, modern Lisps like Clojure, the ease of use of dynamic and general purpose languages like Ruby and Python, and the elegant concurrency of Go.

## Language Features

- **Minimal and Modern Syntax**, striving for elegance and expressivity.
- **Functional**, as in functions are values.
- **Tail-Call Optimized**, recursion without the overhead.
- **Garbage-Collected**, using a mark-and-sweep algorithm.
- **Hygienic Macros**.
- **Continuations**, as a first-class language feature.
- **Concurrent**, with fibers and channels.
- **Batteries Included**, to be a complete and productive tool.
- **Integrated Tooling**, ships as a single binary with all tools.
