Bunny (_bunny_, not _bunny lang_) aims to be a simple, practical, and fun general purpose dynamic programming language.

The motivation is to produce a concrete language specification with wish-list features from it's inspirations. The goal is to bundle the most developer-friendly features into a cohesive and enjoyable language.

It is inspired by a collection of languages including classic Lisp dialects like Common Lisp and Scheme, modern Lisp-inspired languages like Clojure, dynamic and general purpose languages like Ruby and Python, and elegant concurrent languages like Go.

## Language Features

- **Minimal and Modern Syntax**, striving for elegance and expressivity.
- **Functional**, as in functions are values.
- **Tail-Call Optimized**, recursion without the overhead.
- **Garbage-Collected**, using a mark-and-sweep algorithm.
- **Hygienic Macros**.
- **Continuations**, as a first-class language feature.
- **Concurrent**, with fibers and channels.
- **Batteries Included**, to be a complete and productive tool.
- **Integrated Tooling**, ships as a single binary with all tools.
